Pharmaceutical Drug Analysis

## OVERVIEW

This project analyses pharmaceutical drug data to uncover insights about drug manufacturers, approval trends and how side effect severity correlates with both factors. Specifically, the project investigates which manufacturers produce the most approved drugs, if and how approval status relates to side effect severity, and which manufacturers are most associated with severe side effect drugs.
