Pharmaceutical Drug Analysis

## OVERVIEW

This project investigates which manufacturers produce the most approved drugs, if and how approval status relates to side effect severity, and which manufacturers are most associated with severe side effect drugs. The project also provides insight into common drug classes and the variable drug prices amongst manufacturers. 

## **ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES**

- Strengthen SQL fundamentals through practical application (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, HAVING, ALIASES, LIMIT, JOINS, CASE WHEN, UNION)
- Identify which manufacturers and drug classes are most associated with severe side effects, and evaluate how this is related to approval status
- By combining approval data with side effect severity, this project provides insight into the relationship between safety and regulatory approval in the pharmaceutical industry.

## **ðŸ“‚ DATASET**

The dataset contained 15 columns, but this analysis focused on drug name, manufacturer, drug class, side effect severity and price. Other fields (e.g., warnings, batch number and expiry date) were excluded as they were not directly relevant to the project objectives.
