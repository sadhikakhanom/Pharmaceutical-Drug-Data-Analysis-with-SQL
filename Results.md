| AstraZeneca          | Approved  |   3                |

Insights: Moderna Therapeutics and Bayer AG have the highest number of approved drugs in the last 5 years followed by Merck & Co. All 3 manufacturers also produce the top 5 total number of drugs, as displayed in the previous table, indicating a relatively more efficient drug development strategy in comparison to other manufacturers, particularly Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca. Both of these manufacturers have the smallest number of approved drugs in the last 5 years, suggesting challenges in advancing through clinical trials.  

---------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Most Rejected Drugs (Last 5 Years)

| Manufacturer         | Status    | No. Rejected Drugs|
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Novartis AG          |  Rejected |   10              |
| Roche Holding AG     |  Rejected |    8              |

| Sanofi               |  Rejected |    5              |

Insights: Novartis AG leads with the highest number of rejected drugs in the last 5 years. The general distribution of rejected drugs across all manufacturers seems to be quite even, indicating that there are similar regulatory approval challenges across all manufacturers. This could also mean that in the last 5 years, research strategies across all manufacturers have directed focus towards innovation over risk management.

## 5. Manufacturer with the most approved drugs with severe side effects

| Manufacturer        | Severity   | No. Approved Drugs |
|---------------------|------------|--------------------|
| Merck & Co.         | Severe     | 20                 |
| Sanofi              | Severe     | 19                 |
| Johnson & Johnson   | Severe     | 17                 |
| Moderna Therapeutics| Severe     | 15                 |

| GlaxoSmithKline     | Severe     | 12                 |
| AstraZeneca         | Severe     | 12                 |
| Pfizer Inc.         | Severe     | 10                 |
| Bayer AG            | Severe     | 9                  |

Insights: Merck & Co. leads as the manufacturer with the highest number of approved drugs with severe side effects, followed by Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson as a close second. All 3 manufacturers have the largest drug portfolio, and relatively similar approval success rates. Having the highest number of drugs with severe side effects is not necessarily negative, however it is indicative of the common challenges pharmaceutical manufacturers face throughout the drug development pipeline, which is balancing the overall success of a drug in treatment with the side effects that come with utilising them.

-------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Number of Approved Drugs by Side Effect Severity

| Severity  |  Status   | No. Approved Drugs |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------|
| Severe    | Approved  | 140                |
| Moderate  | Approved  | 147                |
| Mild      | Approved  | 175                |

Insights: Most approved drugs have been associated with mild side effects (175), suggesting that safety profiles still remains as one of the most important factors to look out for in the drug development pipline. However the number of approved drugs with severe side effects is still considerably high (140), highlighting that safety is also a factor that can sometimes be compromised if the drug is capable of treating serious/ life threatening conditions. This also emphasises the importance of risk management once the drugs are in widespread use.
